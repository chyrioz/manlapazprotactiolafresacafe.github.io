<p> <font face="Courier" size="4"> The Logo has a lot of strawberry themed desserts and drinks and of course a strawberry. The big strawberry represents the amount of joy we feel when we bite into a strawberry because itâ€™s just so good! The components of the logo are the strawberry (ofcourse), the strawberry cake, the strawberry panna cotta, and the strawberry milkshake. First of all, what is a strawberry? The garden strawberry is a widely grown hybrid species of the genus Fragaria, collectively known as the strawberries, which are cultivated worldwide for their fruit. The fruit is widely appreciated for its characteristic aroma, bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness. How about a stawberry cake? Strawberry cake is a cake that uses strawberry as a primary ingredient. Strawberries may be used in the cake batter, atop the cake, and in the frosting. Strawberry cakes are typically served cold. Panna Cotta? Panna cotta is an Italian dessert of sweetened cream thickened with gelatin and molded. Lastly, what about a strawberry milkshake? A milkshake is a sweet beverage made by blending milk, ice cream, and whole fruit like strawberry into a thick, sweet, cold mixture. Why did we add these beverages to the logo? We wanted to showcase the aesthetic of our products and how it looks. I can guarantee that the beverages that we have are our best-selling ones and we will change our logo whenever our best-selling beverages changes. Why are the colors in our logo mostly pink and green? The strawberry has two main colors, red and green, but since we wanted to make it a bit cute because you know, people today like cute stuff! We switched the colors to pastel pink and green. Did you know that the strawberry has 21 seeds? It resembles the amount of desserts and drinks we have in this restaurant! Here are a few, Strawberry pie, Strawberry frozen yougurt cake, Strawberry yougurt, Strawberry filled bread, Strawberry cake, Strawberry Panna Cotta, Strawberry Jelly, Strawberry Gallette, Fresas Con Crema (Strawberries and Cream) Strawberry Ice cream, Strawberry Pancakes, Strawberry Shortcake, Strawberry pudding, Strawberry wafers, Strawberry Tarts, Strawberry Cookies, Strawberry graham float, Strawberry Shortcake Truffles, Drinks: Strawberry Frappe, Strawberry Lemonade, Strawberry Shake, Strawberry Mimosa, Strawberry Smoothie. </p> </font>
